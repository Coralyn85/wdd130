            <p> Hello. My Name is Coralyn Simons and I live on Maui in Hawaii.  I enjoy traveling, planning moderately priced vacations, reading, playing board games, swimming and spending time with my family. My favorite color is green and my favorite constellation is Orion, because it is easy to find. I also can't spell to save my life and it seems that VS Code doesn't have spell check.  So this should be fun. </p>

            <p>Hawaii is the 49th state to become a part of the United States of America. It was admitted as a state the same year as Alaska, just a few months before.  Prior to becoming part of the USA, it was called the Kingdom of Hawaii.  Lahaina was once the capital of the state, but it was moved to Oahu as time went on. Hawaii is a popular vacation destination and its economy relies on the tourist industry. Recently Maui Hawaii, specifically the former state capital of Lahaina, experienced the worst natural disaster in the past 100 years in the USA with a devastating wildfire that killed 102 people. </p>
