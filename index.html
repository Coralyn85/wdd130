            <p> Hello. My Name is Coralyn Simons and I live on Maui in Hawaii.  I enjoy traveling, planning moderately priced vacations, reading, playing board games, swimming and spending time with my family. My favorite color is green and my favorite constellation is Orion, because it is easy to find. I also can't spell to save my life and it seems that VS Code doesn't have spell check.  So this should be fun. </p>
